### Publishing RNet online
- As the developer of RNet, I decided to share RNet's codes and RNet's dataset (191,070 train images and 191,070 validation images) under the Apache 2.0 license in order to contribute to artificial intelligence research and to help developers develop autonomous driving software for vehicles.
- Citation is required if you are going to use the code or dataset.

### üÜï What's new with RNet v0.3?
- RNet trained with more data. This helps model to find road lanes better on real world examples.
- RNet's predictions about road lanes go through a new filter. In this way, the locations of the road lanes can be determined better.

### FornaxAI's RNet can be used in

- Self driving car
- Lane assisting
- Autonomous delivery vehicles and many more areas that requires drive assist.
